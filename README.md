# Face Recognition and Tracking

This project presents a classical face recognition and tracking system using:
- **Haar Cascade** for face detection  
- **LBPH** (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) for face recognition  
- **KCF** (Kernelized Correlation Filter) for face tracking in video streams  

The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, real-time face recognition via webcam, and robust tracking through bounding box updates.### [ðŸ“„ View full report: Face_recognition_and_tracking.pdf](Face_recognition_and_tracking.pdf)
